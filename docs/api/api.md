## Django REST Framework

### RESTful Routes

Preferring the approach of a hierachical (nested) URL structure, rather flattened (shallow), to ensure consistency, and
provides a clear and explicit indication of the relationship between the user and resource. This approach helps to
prevent potential naming conflicts and provide predicable URL structure. Trying to maintain the practice of including
the user identifier in the URL to make it more explicit and secure. By including the user

Testing api routes with the structure of

- the dynamic segment
    - user identifier `<int:user_id>`

## API Documentation

Swagger and `drf_yasg` are essential tools for Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) API development. Swagger
simplifies the creation fo RESTful APIs by providing a standardised format for documenting and exploring
endpoints. [drf_yasg](https://drf-yasg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) seamlessly integrates Swagger with DRF, automatically
generating API documentation based on serializers, views and viewsets. Together they enhance developer experience,
promote collaboration and ensure up-to-date and interactive API documentation, leading to improved productivity and
easier adoption of APIs.

### Test database

When testing Swagger docs, a separate database needs to be set up to ensure that the test data does not permanently
affect the default database.

To create a new test database, create a new [ElephantSQL](https://elephantsql.com) instance.

1. Login to ElephantSQL account
2. From the dashboard, click on "Create new" button
3. Provide a name for then new instance e.g. app_test
4. Configure the region, version and plan
5. Once the instance has been created, you will land on your "Details" page
6. Copy the "URL" for the new instance, which starts with `postgres://`, set this to an environment variable in the `.env` file
7. Update the `settings.py` file to include the test database configuration
8. Create a new entry in the `DATABASES` dictionary for `test`
9. Set the environment variable in the value for `test` the `settings.py` file

Once this is set up, when running tests, Django will automatically use the test database specified in the `settings.py` file.
